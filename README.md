# Remote team white elephant gift swap party program!

What's that you say? You have a fully remote team that wants to do a present swap?

Hell yeah! We got you covered!

- Build this with go 1.18 +
- Shove it onto a public web server
- Have everyone go to the page, and sign in with a name **and the gift should be the URL to an image of their gift**
- People can open presents, steal presents, whatever
- We didn't add in any of the rules, so it's up to everyone to play nice.
- Open up a video call, and have at it!

Happy Holidays y'all!
